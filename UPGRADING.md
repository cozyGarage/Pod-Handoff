# Upgrade and migration notes

PodHandoff is an educational prerelease with no stable upgrade path. Its API is
separate from the imported Understudy baseline:

- API group: `apps.podhandoff.io`
- kind: `PodHandoff`
- Helm chart and Kubernetes names: `podhandoff`
- metrics prefix: `podhandoff_`

Do not apply the PodHandoff CRD over an Understudy installation. The two
projects use distinct resources and webhooks. See [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md)
for the imported baseline and divergence record. The version-specific notes
below are historical migration references; they are not a recommendation to
upgrade a production cluster to this prerelease.

## Historical PodHandoff version notes

## 0.4.0 to 0.4.1

`hostageMode` is now `holdMode`. The old spelling described a budget that
took evictions hostage, and there is no budget any more.

Nothing breaks. Both fields are accepted, `holdMode` wins when both are
set, and a resource that sets only the old one keeps working while the
operator raises a single warning event against it. The old field is
deprecated; rename it when convenient:

```sh
kubectl get podhandoffs -A \
  -o custom-columns=NS:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,OLD:.spec.hostageMode \
  | grep -v '<none>'
```

The `MODE` column of `kubectl get podhandoffs` now reports the mode the
operator actually resolved, from `status.mode`, whichever field set it.

## 0.3.x to 0.4.0

The mechanism changed underneath you. PodHandoff used to own a
PodDisruptionBudget sized to block every eviction; it now owns nothing and
answers the eviction itself, at admission, with the same 429 the budget
returned. The reason is that a budget is visible to a disrupter before it
acts, so a protected singleton could stop its node from ever being
consolidated, drifted or expired. A hold is invisible until the moment of
the attempt, so that class of stuck node cannot happen.

### What you have to do

Run `helm upgrade`. The rest is automatic, and worth verifying once:

```sh
kubectl get pdb -A -l podhandoff.io/owned=true      # expect none
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration | grep podhandoff
```

At startup the operator sweeps away every budget it used to own, once,
under leader election so it cannot race an old replica. The webhook
configuration is renamed from `<release>-eviction-observer` to
`<release>-eviction-hold`, the failsafe CronJob and its RBAC are removed,
and the serving certificate is carried across the upgrade rather than
regenerated.

### Chart values

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| `signals.evictionWebhook` | gone; the webhook is the mechanism and is always on |
| `signals.evictionWebhookTimeoutSeconds` | `webhook.timeoutSeconds` |
| `signals.evictionWebhookNamespaceSelector` | `webhook.namespaceSelector` |
| `signals.pinDetection` | gone with the budget it detected |
| `failsafe.*` | gone; there is no budget left to clean up after |

Removed keys in your values file are ignored rather than rejected, so an
upgrade will not fail on them, but they no longer do anything.

### Metrics

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| `podhandoff_pdb_relaxed_total` | `podhandoff_hold_relaxed_total`, same `reason` label |
| `podhandoff_node_pinned_total` | gone |
| - | `podhandoff_evictions_held_total`, evictions answered with 429 |

`podhandoff_oldest_blocked_eviction_seconds` is unchanged and is still the
one to alert on.

### Two behaviours worth knowing

Protection now depends on the API server reaching the webhook. That is the
default nearly everywhere, but a private control plane with narrow security
groups can block it, and because the webhook fails open the result looks
exactly like a healthy install with nothing to do. The webhook architecture
and its fail-open tradeoff are described in
[the architecture guide](docs/architecture.md).

Operator downtime now means no protection, immediately, where a budget
would have kept blocking. That is the deliberate trade for never wedging a
cluster, and the answer to it is `replicaCount: 2`: every replica serves
the webhook, and only reconciliation takes the leader lease.

### Rolling back

`helm rollback` returns you to 0.3.x, which recreates its budgets on the
next reconcile. Nothing in 0.4.0 destroys state that 0.3.x needs.
